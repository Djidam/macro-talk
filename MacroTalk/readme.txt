MacroTalk - v2.3.2
By Cogwheel, taken over by Djidam

Disabling Modules

If you would prefer only to have certain functionality from MacroTalk (for instance, if you have another addon that provides similar functionality), you can disable various modules by renaming or deleting the corresponding .lua files. You can safely remove MacroTalkChatOptions, MacroTalkCommands, and MacroTalkSubstitutions which correspond to Conditional/Random chat commands, Slash commands, and Text substitutions, respectively.

Slash commands

tellunit (/tu, /whisperunit, /wu) <unit> <message>
Sends a whisper to the specified unit. See http://www.wowwiki.com/API_TYPE_UnitId for a list of units

Example :

/cast Innervate
/tellunit target Incoming innervate

/group (/gr) <message>

Picks battleground, raid, or party chat depending on which type of group you are in.

/opt [options] <slash command>; [options] <slash command>; ... 

Picks from multiple slash commands given the options. You can only use slash commands that don't trigger secure functions. Chat commands, emotes, scripts, etc. are OK. /cast, /use, etc. are off limits.
Note: the sub-commands cannot use macro options since the semicolons would cause ambiguity.

Example :

/opt [button:2] /bye; /wave 

/rndcmd [options] <command 1>\<command 2>; [options] <command 3>\<command 4>... 

Picks a random slash command out of the group chosen based on the given options. Each group is a list of slash commands separated by the backslash (\) character (this is in contrast to commas used for the built-in random commands--commas are just too common in chat messages).
Note: like the /opt command, the sub-commands cannot use macro options and you can't use any secure commands.

Example :

rndcmd [swimming] /y Help! I'm Drowning! \ /s The water's great!;
/s Time for a swim... \ /dance

Conditional chat commands

All chat commands (/say, /tell, /guild, etc.) can now accept macro options. To use this functionality, simply start the command with /opt. 
Note: [target=] has no effect on the output of the chat commands; it only affects the other conditionals in the clause.

Example :

/optsay [swimming] gurgle; [mounted] The cavalry has arrived!

Example :

/cast [target=focus] Polymorph
/optgroup [target=focus, exists] Sheeping %f[/i]


Random chat commands

Similar to the macro options, you can now add /rnd to the beginning of any chat command to pick a random saying. The /rnd___ commands also take options to pick a different list of sayings. The lists themselves are separated by the backslash symbol (\).

Example : 

/rndyell ZOMG! \ WTF?! \ You there! Check out that noise!

Example :

/rndsay [outdoors] Ahhh, the Great Outdoors! \ What a lovely day!;
I wish I could go outside right now \ Must... Leave... Building...[/i]


Clearing WayPoint/Pin command

MacroTalk added a command to allow you to clear your WayPoint easilly.
Use /clearwaypoint or /cwp to do the trick."


Text substitutions

MacroTalk offers a variety of substitutions in addition to %t of the default UI. Substitutions are prioritized by the length of the code; longer codes are processed first. This means that %tl will be processed before %t. The codes are case-insensitive so %Tl is equivalent to %tL.

Straight substitutions:

%n - Your name
%z - Your current zone
%sz - Your current sub-zone
%loc - Your map coordinates
%wp - Link a pin to your current location and then remove it
%pin - Link a pin you've manually added to the map

 Unit information:

%t - Name of your target (built in, but listed for consistency)
%f - Name of your focus
%m - Name of mouseover unit
%p - Name of your pet
%tt - Name of your target's target

You can suffix those with one of the following to return other pieces of data about the unit:

l - Level
c - Class
g - Gender
gb - Gender (blank if no gender)
r - Race
rb - Race (blank if no race)
gu - Guild
gub - Guild (blank if no guild)
rm - Realm
h - Health (XX/XX) - Acts like hp for players not in your party/raid/bg
hp - Health percentage (XX%)
pw - Power - Depending on the unit power, can be mana, focus, energy and so on
pwb - Power (blank if no power)
pwp - Power percentage
pwpb - Power percentage (blank if no mana)
ic - Raid icon
icb - Raid icon (blank if no icon)
gn - Raid group number - Only if target is in the same raid as you, or you are in a raid
gnb - Raid group number (blank if no raid group)

Example :

/p Sheeping %f (level %fl %fg %fr %fc)
/cast [target=focus] Polymorph

Sample result: Sheeping Cogwheel (level 64 male Gnome Warrior)

You can also use the suffixes without a unit code to return information about yourself.

Example :

/s I'm a level %l, %g, %r %c.

Sample result: I'm a level 68, male, gnome warrior.
